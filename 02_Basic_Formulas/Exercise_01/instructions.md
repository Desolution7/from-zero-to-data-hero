# Exercise 01 – Working with Formulas and Functions

## Objective
Practice using Excel formulas and built-in functions to perform sales calculations and summary analysis.

## Part A: Working with Formulas
1. Calculate **Total Sales** for all customers in column D.
2. Autofill the formula down the column.
3. Calculate **Sales Tax** for all customers in column E using the sales tax value in cell I2.
4. Autofill the formula down, ensuring the correct type of cell referencing is used.
5. Calculate **Total Including Tax** in column F.
6. Autofill the formula down the column.
7. Change the **Sales Tax** rate to 6% and confirm all related values update automatically.

## Part B: Using Functions in Calculations
1. In cell 14, calculate the **Total Sales**.
2. In cell 15, calculate the **Average Quantity** of items bought.
3. In cell 16, calculate the **Minimum Price Per Item**.
4. In cell 17, calculate the **Maximum Price Per Item**.
5. In cell 18, calculate the **Total Number of Customers**.

## Outcome
- Applied Excel formulas and autofill efficiently
- Used absolute and relative cell references correctly
- Performed summary calculations using built-in functions
- Verified dynamic updates when input values changed
