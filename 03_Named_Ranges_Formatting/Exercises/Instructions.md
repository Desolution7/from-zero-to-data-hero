# Milestone 3 – Named Ranges (Exercises)

## Naming Ranges
1. Name the following data ranges:
- A2:A52 → Customer_Name
- B2:B52 → Quantity
- C2:C52 → Price_Per_Item
- D2:D52 → Total
- E2:E52 → Sales_Tax
- F2:F52 → Total_Inc_Tax

2. Name range H2:I2 as:
- Tax_Rate

> Note: Different methods for creating named ranges were used (Name Box, Define Name, Create from Selection).

## Using Named Ranges in Formulas
1. Replace the reference to cell I2 in the Sales Tax formula (Column E) with the named range.
2. Recalculate formulas in cells I4:I8 using named ranges instead of cell references.
