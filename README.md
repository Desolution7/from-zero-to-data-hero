# From Zero to Data Hero: My Data Analysis Journey

Welcome to my personal learning roadmap documenting my journey to becoming a **Data Analyst**.  
This journey focuses on mastering **Excel, SQL, Python, Pandas, and NumPy** using free, high-quality YouTube resources.

## 🎯 Goal
To gain hands-on data analysis skills and build portfolio-ready projects while studying at the University of the People.

## ⏳ Plan
I will dedicate **2 hours daily**:
- **1 hour** of structured learning through videos  
- **1 hour** of active self-practice or mini projects  

Due to my academic schedule, this roadmap is organized **monthly** instead of weekly.
